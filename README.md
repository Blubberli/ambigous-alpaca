# ambigous-alpaca

Building classifier for different aspects of lexical semantics (focus on words and short phrases), for example:
- semantic selection (attributes) or relations (compound relations)
- conceptual relations (hypernymy, meronymy)
- word sense induction / disambiguation
- prototypicality

It is used to investigate what kind of meaning is already present in different vector representations and whether specific meaning can be carved out through supervision and composition.

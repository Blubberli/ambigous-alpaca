# ambigous-alpaca

This repository works on building classifier for different aspects of lexical semantics of words and short phrases, for example:
- semantic selection (attributes) or relations (compound relations, adjective noun relations)
- conceptual relations (hypernymy, meronymy)
- word sense induction / disambiguation
- prototypicality

It is used to investigate what word meaning is already present in different vector representations and whether specific meaning can be carved out through supervision and composition.
